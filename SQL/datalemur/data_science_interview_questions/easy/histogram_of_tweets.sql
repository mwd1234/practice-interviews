-- Assume you're given a table Twitter tweet data, write a query to obtain a histogram of tweets posted per user in 2022. 
-- Output the tweet count per user as the bucket and the number of Twitter users who fall into that bucket.

-- In other words, group the users by the number of tweets they posted in 2022 and count the number of users in each group.
